The term \"tend\" refers to the general direction that a comet moves in, and \"related to\" is used to indicate that two things share a connection or relationship. The term \"aphelion\" refers to the point in a comet's orbit where it is farthest from the sun, while \"perihelion\" refers to the point where it is closest to the sun. The term \"nonperiodic\" refers to the fact that a comet's orbit is not a regular, repeating pattern. The term \"mandelbrot set\" is a set of points in a topological space that are related to a comet's orbit. The term \"test\" refers to a check or examination of something, and \"related to\" is used to indicate that two things share a connection or relationship. The term \"parabolic\" refers to the shape of a comet's orbit, which is a parabola. The term \"asteroid\" refers to a small, rocky object in outer space, and \"outer space\" refers to the vast, empty space beyond the Earth's atmosphere.\"\n\nBased on the text provided, the answer that is most likely to be correct is:\n\n\"Comets tend to have parabolic orbits, meaning they follow a path that is not periodic and does not repeat itself.\"\n\nThis answer choice is supported by the text's mention of \"parabolic\" and \"nonperiodic\" comets, as well as its description of comets' orbits as following a path that is not periodic and does not repeat itself. The text also provides additional information about the location of comets in outer space and their relationship to the sun, which further supports this answer choice."
